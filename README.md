----

This project includes patterns and modules that can be used to create a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster on a cloud service using [Terraform](https://terraform.io/). It also provides an example of how to use these patterns and modules to create a cluster and integrate it with [VESSL](https://vessl.ai/). By following this example, you can set up and maintain a complete Kubernetes cluster and use VESSL to run containerized ML workloads seamlessly on top of it.

The examples are listed below:

**Amazon Web Services**
* [AWS EKS - Provisioning a Cluster to an Existing VPC](examples/aws-eks-existing-vpc)

**Google Cloud Platform**
* [GCP GKE - Full example with VPC Network](examples/gcp-gke-full)
